# Resume Screening System

This project presents an AI-powered Resume
Screening System that automatically evaluates how well a resume matches a job description. Using NLP techniques, a semantic similarity model (SentenceTransformer), and a fine-tuned DistilBERT classifier, the system understands both keywords and context. It generates a Match Score, fit prediction, and improvement suggestions while supporting PDF, DOCX, and TXT resumes. A Gradio interface provides an easy, interactive platform for users. This solution helps reduce manual screening time and improves hiring accuracy
